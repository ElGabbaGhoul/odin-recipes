Current Project, Monday, April 4th, 2022.

I am beginning my work on a recipe for The Odin Project foundations. I have no idea what a recipe is. 
But I can make directories, files, and download things using git from github. I'll probably be using those
skills as well as some new ones when making these recipes.
