    <h3>Description</h3>
    Are we even surprised? By now we already know the air fryer is supreme. The fact that crispy golden chicken can be achieved without the use of any oil whatsoever is amazing and that's not to mention how quickly the air fryer can do it! This chicken parm tastes every bit as good as the traditional version with much less effort to get there. The air fryer will even melt and broil your cheese for a perfect cheesy, crispy bite!
